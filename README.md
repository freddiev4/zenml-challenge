# zenml-challenge

Contains a simple pipeline built using zenml, during the ZenML Challenge in October 2022.

Used this as an opportunity to test out another mlops stack, rather than compete.

## Usage

```console
# install dependencies
$ poetry install

# start the zenml server
$ zenml up

# run the training pipeline
$ python src/training_pipeline.py
```
